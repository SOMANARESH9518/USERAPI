http://127.0.0.1:8000/api2/api_user/

Lists the Users in the form of JSON format and can be used for Posting the Data

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api2/api_user/id/

<br>
List the Particular User with the id

<p>Before Starting the App, you have to clear the data from visits.pickle which will clear the local cache of NBR_VISITS(total visits of home link till now)</p>

In the home, you can find a Search bar with options username,email,date.

I have used icontains to search for users with case insensitive.
